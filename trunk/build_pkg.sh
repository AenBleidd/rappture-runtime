#!/bin/bash

# This is a demonstration build script for the rappture runtime environment.  
# Ideally it should be as simple as 
#
#	configure
#	make
#	make install
#
# Because of build dependencies, Tcl/Tk must be built and installed first.  
# Therefore there are at least 2 stages of configure-make-makeinstall: 
# one for Tcl/Tk, one for the rest of the runtime (and one for visualization - 
# which is optional). 
#
#	mkdir stage1 stage2 stage3 
#
#  	cd stage1
#	../runtime/configure
#	make 
# 	make install
#
#  	cd stage2
#	../runtime/configure
#	make 
# 	make install
#
#  	cd stage3
#	../runtime/configure
#	make 
# 	make install
#
# This is basically what this script does. 
#
# The build normally should be done outside of the runtime directory.  You can
# use create a temporary directory and run configure from within it to create 
# the necessary Makefiles and auxillary files to build.  You can dispose of 
# the directory once the stage is built and installed.

#
# Notes:  There are several variations of this basic script.
#	  1. a demonstation script to help build rappture.
#	  2. a build script for the nanohub.
#	  3. a build script for the Build-and-test environment.
#
# 	  This script should not perform all three functions. 
#	  The demonstation script is supposed to be simple and obvious.
#	  The nanohub script will handle the peculiarities of the nanohub 
#	  deployment process.  The Build-and-test script is also peculiar 
#	  to the build-and-test environment.
