This directory is wrapper for the zlib distribution.

Zlib must be built in the same directory as its sources. 
We use this directory to copy (via configure) of the sources
to the build subdirectory.  The Makefile simply relays the
make all/install/clean/distclean commands to the Makefile in the 
copied directory.

The good news is that you probably don't need to build zlib
yourself as your system probably has a version already.
