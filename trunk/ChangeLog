 * (Re)fixed cut/paste with menus (menu.tcl).  This is a bug in Tk
   distributions that's been there forever.  This fix was lost when I
   upgraded to tk8.4.19.
 * Upgraded to latest (r3478) version of pymol from sourceforge.net.
   This was done in the process of upgrading to 64-bit render servers.
 * Changed how pymol is built.  Our pymol server specific changes are
   now kept in a patch file applied on each build. This should make it easier
   to upgrade from pymol versions on sourceforge.net.
 * Added exit handler to BLT bgexec to kill remaining subprocesses on exit.
   Some application were setting the magic status variable to kill the
   remaining subprocesses but then called exit.  The variable trace never
   fired as Tcl never got back to its event loop.
 * Fixed Makefile.in in BLT to better handle parallel builds (-j6) in
   gmake.
